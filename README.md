### Hello, I'm Gary ðŸ‘‹

Developer, Director, Dad

For the past 30 years Iâ€™ve been a professional developer in a variety of languages. Iâ€™ve worked in a wide variety of sectors including aviation, telecommunications, government, charity, financial and so on.

While Iâ€™m able to design a reasonable user interface I much prefer to work on back end and low-level systems.
