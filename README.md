### Hello, I'm Gary ðŸ‘‹

Developer, Director, Dad

For the past 30 years Iâ€™ve been a professional developer in a variety of languages. Iâ€™ve worked in a wide variety of sectors including aviation, telecommunications, government, distributed ledger (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Monero etc), charity, financial and so on.

While Iâ€™m able to design a reasonable user interface I much prefer to work on back end and low-level systems.

You might want to take a look at my [`hid4java`](https://github.com/gary-rowe/hid4java) project or [review my blog](https://gary-rowe.com).
